## Quality and Risk Comparison

### Code Quality

| Factor | Cursor Agent | Claude Conversational |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Syntax Accuracy** | ✅ Self-validating | ⚠️ Requires manual checking |
| **Integration Testing** | ✅ Autonomous testing | ❌ Manual integration required |
| **Error Resolution** | ✅ Self-debugging | ❌ Human must debug |
| **Consistency** | ✅ Uniform patterns | ✅ Uniform patterns |
| **Performance** | ✅ Can profile and optimize | ❌ Cannot test performance |
| **Security** | ✅ Automated security scans | ⚠️ Requires human security review |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Type | Cursor Agent | Claude Conversational |

## Cursor Agent Workflow for ITDB

### Autonomous Execution Plan
```
1. Agent analyzes entire ITDB codebase (src/ directory)
2. Generates complete SlimPHP architecture plan
3. Creates new directory structure and base files
4. Iteratively migrates each PHP module:
   - Extracts functions from model.php
   - Creates corresponding services and controllers
   - Converts templates to Twig
   - Updates all references and dependencies
   - Runs tests after each migration
   - Self-corrects any errors found
5. Performs integration testing across all components
6. Optimizes performance based on benchmarks
7. Generates comprehensive documentation
8. Creates deployment scripts and instructions
```

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks of autonomous work (24/7 capability)

### Human Checkpoints
- **Day 1**: Review initial architecture plan
- **Day 3-4**: Review first migrated modules
- **Day 7**: Mid-point progress validation
- **Day 10-14**: Final review and deployment preparation
